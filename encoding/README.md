History
-------

The [`asn1-encoding`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/asn1-encoding) package
was originated and then maintained by Vincent Hanquez. For published
reasons, he does not intend to develop the package further after version 0.9.6
but he also does not want to introduce other maintainers.
