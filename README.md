ASN.1 for Haskell
=================

Originally forked from
[asn1-types-0.3.4](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/asn1-types-0.3.4),
[asn1-parse-0.9.5](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/asn1-parse-0.9.5) and
[asn1-encoding-0.9.6](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/asn1-encoding-0.9.6).

* crypton-asn1-types : basic types for ASN.1 representation.
* crypton-asn1-parse : combinator based parsers for ASN.1 types.
* crypton-asn1-encoding : BER and DER encoding decoder and encoder.

History
-------

The [`asn1-types`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/asn1-types),
[`asn1-parse`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/asn1-parse) and
[`asn1-encoding`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/asn1-encoding) packages
were each originated and then maintained by Vincent Hanquez. For published
reasons, he does not intend to develop the packages further after versions
0.3.4, 0.9.5 and 0.9.6 (respectively) but he also does not want to introduce
other maintainers.
